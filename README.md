# AspNetCorePipeSample
A basic (non-production ready!) sample of using ASP.NET Core 3.0 BodyReader and BodyWriter.

Purpose:
Prototype of using the newly exposed `Request.BodyReader` (PipeReader) and `Response.BodyWriter` (PipeWriter) exposed on the `HttpContext`. Also used to experiement with the latest System.Text.Json APIs.

**Important** - This code is intended as a sample only. It is not well tested nor validated as a best-practice approach for this scenario.
